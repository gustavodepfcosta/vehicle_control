A simple program that consists in having a basic database (no database connected) of up to 10 vehicles - Brand, Model, Year of Fabrication and License Plate.

In the program, you'll be given 5 menu choices, which are to list all registered vehicles, to insert new vehicles, to list the vehicles above a specified year of fabrication or to filter them by year of fabrication or model. 

The input getter method used was scanf(), which I've learned it is not a good practice (neither it is to use fflush(stdin)), but I'll manage to improve my coding on my next C projects. 

Thank you for reading.
